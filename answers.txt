1. Coercion is another term for which of the following concepts in Python?
    d) Implicit type conversion

        Implicit conversion or coercion is when data type conversion takes place either
        during compilation or during run time and is handled directly by Python for you.
        The compiler does this to prevent data loss, often by converting value
        types to a supertype that enacapsulates the types of the uncompiled values.

2. Type casting is another term for which of the following concepts in Python?
    c) Explicit type conversion

        Explicit conversion also known as type casting is when data type conversion takes
        place because you clearly defined it in your program. There is a risk of data loss
        involved with explicit type conversion.
 
3. What function in Python can we use to check a variable's type?
    a) type()
        
        Returns <class 'variable type'>

4. Which of the following is NOT a primitive data structure?
    c) List
        
        Lists are collections of primitive data type values, similar to an array in JavaScript, and
        are classified as non-primitive data types.

5. According to the article, what is the main reason to convert a tuple into a list?

    You want to make changes to the initial tuple. Thus, you can convert them to lists and
    then make the change, then convert them back to tuples.
