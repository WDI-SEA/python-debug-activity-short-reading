5. According to the article, what is the main reason to convert a tuple into a list?
"you may want to make changes to the initial tuple. Thus, you can convert them to 
lists and then make the change, then convert them back to tuples."
The conversion is made to make changes to a tuple, which is immmutable in it's original form.  
And once its converted to a list and modified, it can be coverted back to tuple to 
make it immutable again.
